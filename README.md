IBM Z System Automation collection
==================================

The **IBM Z System Automation collection**, also represented as **ibm_zos_sysauto** in this document,
consists of roles and sample playbooks that you can use with the
[operations REST server component](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/de/SSWRCJ_4.2.0/com.ibm.safos.doc_4.2/Integrating.html)
of IBM Z System Automation.

This collection allows Ansible to create and delete [dynamic resources](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/de/SSWRCJ_4.2.0/com.ibm.safos.doc_4.2/UserGuide/Dynamic_Resources.html)
from a template defined in the current active policy of an IBM Z System Automation environment.
It interacts with IBM Z System Automation with help of its Operations REST API.
